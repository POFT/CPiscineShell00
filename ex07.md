1. Download resources
   
        wget <url>

2 . Understand the command patch:

    man patch
    patch [options] [originalfile [patchfile]]

3. Create file b with differences between file a and sw.diff:
Text Compare! - Find differences between two text files

        patch a -o b sw.diff

-o outfile  or  --output=outfile

[How to:]
Send output to outfile instead of patching files in place. Do not use this option if outfile is one of the files to be patched.  When outfile is -, send output to standard output, and  send  any messages that would usually go to standard output to standard error.
